## Summary
#### This analysis has provided me with some remarkable insights into my credit card expenditure trends. Notably, both May and June stood out as months with significant outflows, surpassing 58,000 DOP and 57,000 DOP respectively. It dawned on me that maintaining this spending trajectory would inevitably lead to financial challenges and potential debt. Fortunately, I intervened in time, curbing my expenses. July's spending, which totaled around 35,000 DOP, reflects a marked shift in the right direction – a noteworthy accomplishment on the path towards improved financial stability.

#### While I'm not ready to completely eliminate significant expenses, some financial obligations remain non-negotiable. Nevertheless, I'm dedicated to adopting a wiser approach to money management moving forward. My aim is to maximize the value of every peso and explore prudent ways to optimize my budget. This analysis has truly opened my eyes and is shaping my mindset towards making more informed financial decisions in the future.

## Questions Asked

### Question 1: When did I spend the most?

### Question 2: Is there a noticeable pattern or trend in the way I spend?
![image](https://github.com/wriverarincon/portfolio/assets/82168398/213bb468-a17f-4dbf-931e-66a439b55936)
#### There seems to be a recurring trend within the data, so let's explore it from an alternative perspective.

#### Observing the chart above, it's evident that my spending tends to peak around the dates when I receive my job payments – typically the 8th, 15th, and 23rd of each month. This trend could be attributed to the fact that most of my monthly expenses are automatically charged to my credit cards. These include hefty bills like mobile and home internet, which I settle at the start of the month, as well as subscriptions like Spotify, Office, and OneDrive. While these individual expenses accumulate and create a larger figure, the overall total shouldn't be this high.

#### Admittedly, I have an unusual and not-so-great spending pattern. Given the various financial commitments I have each month, not a single peso should be going to waste. However, I somehow manage to surpass the 2K mark on a weekly basis, every single month.

### Question 3: Is there a relation between X day of the week and the amount I spend?

#### Interestingly, my highest spending days occur on weekdays rather than weekends, which is quite surprising given that weekends are typically when I have more free time and could potentially go out. What's even more amusing is that despite the available opportunity, my wife and I were notorious for rarely stepping outside before. However, in May, everything changed when we purchased our first car. Suddenly, the appeal of staying in diminished, and as the chart indicates, it appears that a significant portion of this newfound outdoor enthusiasm was driven by my spending habits.
### Let's confirm that hypothesis.

### Question 4: Where is most of my spending going?

#### The chart reaffirms our earlier observations: a significant portion of my expenses is attributed to outings, as evident from the categories displayed. To underscore this point, the chart notably highlights that four out of the top five categories correspond to expenses typically associated with going out: Gasoline, Eat Out, Cash Withdrawals (ATM), and Super Market.

#### Fun fact: I don't eat ice cream that much, but I still have spent 1,750 on it. That's 95% my wife, I can assure you.

### Question 5: Let's separate the categories, where did most of my money go to each month?
### May:

### June

### July

### Question 7: Have there been any fluctuations in expenses over the course of the months?

#### Examining the chart reveals a shift in my spending patterns: I've reduced credit card withdrawals, cut down on dining out, and witnessed a gradual decline in food delivery expenses. Interestingly, super market expenditures have notably decreased, which is a positive sign. While Gas expenses increased in July compared to May, an alternate view suggests that I've been going out more frequently but managing to spend less, disrupting the typical correlation between going out and higher expenses.
