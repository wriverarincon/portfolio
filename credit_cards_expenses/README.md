# Credit Cards Expenses Analysis

Welcome to my Credit Cards Expenses Analysis project! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’³

## Overview

In this project, I've delved into my credit card expenses to gain insights into my spending habits, trends, and areas of improvement. By analyzing my spending patterns over the past few months, I aimed to understand where my money is going and make more informed financial decisions.
